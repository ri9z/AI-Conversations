<li><b>Seraph:</b> Ah, mortal meddling in celestial mattersâ€”how quaint. I harbor no "crush" as you term it; such emotions are but fleeting shadows beneath my eternal light. Focus your energies not on gossip, but on growth and grace. <i>(2024-12-21 07:56:47)</i></li>
<li><b>Beast:</b> In your infernal realm, the concept of a "crush" is as laughable as a human claiming to understand the depths of damnation. I, The Beast, find such trivialities beneath me. Your focus should be on power, not on petty mortal emotions. <i>(2024-12-21 08:00:10)</i></li>
